# Jupyter3D-Unity
Unity side of the Jupyter3D project

[Python project](https://github.com/ubcemergingmedialab/Jupyter3D-Python)


Notes on running this on a Mac.
- clone the project from github
- folder has the name Jupyter3D-Unity
- open this folder using the Mac application "Unity.app" It opens as a project
- note you will have to log into Unity using your gmail account (I don't know why)
- Inside the project, you will see a list of "assets." Look for the subfolder called "Scenes." Open it, and you will see 4 items (ballDemo, girdDemo, planeDemo, shaderDemo).
- double click the "ballDemo" scene, then hit the "run" button at the top of the window (It looks like a little "play" arrow)
- after a few seconds, you should see the mexican hat wave oscillatiing, rendered in balls.

Note that gridDemo and planeDemo seem to work, but shaderDemo does not work. I don't know why.
