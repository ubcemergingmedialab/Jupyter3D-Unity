# Jupyter3D Project v1.0

## Project Information

This repository hosts the Jupyter3D project, a set of tools to allow users to display and interact with data in Virtual Reality (VR). Jupyter's main goal is to help students' understanding and intuition for physics without the expense of building and operating a physics lab. The project creates a VR experience in which studdents can visualize and walk around 3D static wave surface which is a "snapshot" or series of snapshots of a physically realistic, dynamic wave. Students can demonstrate their knowledge by placing a virtual "flagpole" at a spot on the wave surface, showing that they have found an area of interest in the simulation. 

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Unity 2017.4.26f
- Oculus
- HTC Unity Plugin
- C#

### Getting Started
1. Make not of the Oculus controller; both left and right hand controllers are used. 
2. Adjust your headset for comfort. 
3. Open up & play the 'gridDemo2' scene.
4. Use the controllers to play around with the wave.
  - Right controller functions
    - Grip: Hold to plant the flag.
    - Joystick: Press reset and remove flags [will remove all the flags].
    - Trigger: Hold to move the flag around + rotate.
    - Trigger + Joystick: Move wave forward and back.
    
  - Left controller functions
    - Grip: divides the wavelength by a factor of 2. 
    - Joystick: Press to change the wave type. 
    - Trigger: Play & pause the scene. 
    - Joystick: Move up and down to adjust the wave amplitude.
