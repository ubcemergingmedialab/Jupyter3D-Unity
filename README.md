# Jupyter3D Project v1.1

## Project Information

This repository hosts the Jupyter3D project, a set of tools to allow users to display and interact with data in Virtual Reality (VR). Jupyter's main goal is to help students' understanding and intuition for physics without the expense of building and operating a physics lab. The project creates a VR experience in which studdents can visualize and walk around 3D static wave surface which is a "snapshot" or series of snapshots of a physically realistic, dynamic wave. Students can demonstrate their knowledge by placing a virtual "flagpole" at a spot on the wave surface, showing that they have found an area of interest in the simulation. 

### Version 1.1 Update (Release Date: December 5, 2019)

This version includes a number of new features as well as improvements for the Jupyter Project. This udapte: 
- Removes majority of the controls of the application from the controllers. 
- Adds a new menu on the scene to allow users to adjust wave properties. 
- Improves a number of visual elements and overall user experience.  


### Tools & Technologies Used
- Unity 2017.4.26f
- Oculus
- HTC Unity Plugin
- C#

### Getting Started
1. Make not of the Oculus controller; both left and right hand controllers are used. 
2. Adjust your headset for comfort. 
3. Open up & play the 'gridDemo2' scene.
4. Use the controllers to play around with the wave.
  - Right controller functions
    - Grip: Hold to plant the flag.
    - Trigger: Hold to move the wave around. 
    - Trigger + Joystick: Move wave forward and back.
    
  - Left controller functions
    - Trigger: Hold to move the wave around.
